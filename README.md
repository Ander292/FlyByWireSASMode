# FlyByWireSASMode

This Kerbal Space Program plugin adds a new **fly by wire** SAS mode.

When enabled, pitch and yaw inputs don't control the vessel directly anymore, but instead control the position of a custom navball direction marker that the SAS will follow automatically.

The **fly by wire** mode is available for pilots and probe cores at the same SAS level as the target and maneuver modes, but this is configurable in the ```settings.cfg``` file.
