# FlyByWireSASMode

This KSP plugin adds a new "fly by wire" SAS mode.

When enabled, pitch and yaw inputs don't control the vessel directly anymore, but instead control the position of a custom navball direction marker that the SAS will follow automatically.

The "fly by wire" mode is available for pilots and probe cores at the same SAS level as the target and maneuver modes, but this is configurable in the "settings.cfg" file.
